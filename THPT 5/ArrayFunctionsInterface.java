/**
 * This interface specifies several
 * methods for operations on an array of double
 * (or int) values.
 * 
 * An interface in Java 7 is made up of method heading only.
 * These are abstract methods. The interface is abstract as well but
 * because the Java compiler already "knows" this, you do not use the
 * keyword abstract in the class heading.
 * 
 * If there are any fields specified, they must be public, static, and final.
 * Because an interface is abstract, an interface cannot be instantiated.
 * 
 * An interface is used for design purposes and for allowing classes to be considered
 * various types. In Java, you can only inherit from one superclass.
 * 
 * What a programmer does is implement an interface.
